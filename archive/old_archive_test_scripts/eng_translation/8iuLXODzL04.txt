["Without even shedding a tear",
"Leaving behind all the days we spent",
"Goodbye, it's the first",
"The sound of someone echoing in the morning I welcomed alone",
"In the room where we spent time together",
"I kept thinking with my eyes closed",
"Who is to blame?",
"I don't know, it's not anyone's fault",
"We've done it countless times",
"Yes, for many years, for sure",
"It will just end with goodbye",
"Well, there's no helping it, for sure",
"The words that spilled out without thinking of welcoming you back are different",
"In the morning I welcomed alone",
"I suddenly think of someone",
"The everyday moments we spent together",
"Are still there as if they were natural",
"You're the one to blame",
"Is that right? Am I to blame?",
"Probably",
"This is also a typical love, right?",
"That's the final answer",
"We gradually led each other, that's also just a familiar story",
"In those shining days",
"Pride keeps piling up",
"We've done it countless times",
"Yes, for many years, for sure",
"We'll walk on the road that follows goodbye, there's no helping it",
"You'll come back, and as always, the words will overflow",
"There are countless things we can't understand, for sure",
"We can't forgive everything",
"So let's just endure the days of kindness",
"If we've come to feel that way day after day",
"We can't go back",
"We've done it countless times",
"Yes, for many years, for sure",
"It will just end with goodbye",
"Well, there's no helping it, for sure",
"You're back, the words that spilled out unintentionally are different, but",
"But no matter how many times, for sure, for many years",
"If we could go back to the beginning",
"What would we think, I wonder",
"You're back, I laughed at the words that didn't reach me and spilled out",
"It's a slightly chilly morning"]
