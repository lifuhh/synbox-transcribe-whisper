Now
In the quiet night
Within
Aimlessly
The car
Was driven
To your left
Your
Profile
Was
Illuminated by the moon
Just like searching for memories
Tracing them
If we connect words together
The overflowing memories of the days
From the day I decided to live by your side
Little by little
The world began to change
To be strong
To hide the weakness
In the days I acted
One day it appeared
Just as it was
It taught me things I didn't know
If there is something to protect
Just that alone
Can make you this strong
In the deep
Deep darkness
We met
And spent time together
Unintentional
Days
Were comfortable
No
They were happy
Surely, look
I was saved
By you
Captured a faint light
It shone like a shooting star
Tears
Flowed and spilled from an awkward life
Beautiful
Tears
The kindness decided by a strong, large
Body
Even that somewhat pained face
I find dear
It's not about appearance, I finally realized
A gunshot resounds without reason
Tearing through the night
The breath of farewell
Is slow to rise
The poignant brilliance
An incomparable flowing
Star
The prayer
Just
Disappeared without reaching
Burned out in my hand
The gentle yellow comet
The beautiful mane
Was gripped in the darkness
