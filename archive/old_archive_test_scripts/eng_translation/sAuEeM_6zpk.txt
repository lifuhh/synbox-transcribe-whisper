["Decorating the night sky, beautiful flowers",
"Tightly embracing the voices of the city, light envelops",
"A soundless world for just the two of us",
"I heard the words 'I love you'",
"The future I saw in my dreams",
"On a summer night, our shadows side by side",
"The last fireworks rise into the sky",
"When they disappear, it's a signal",
"Same as always, in the morning, your usual figure",
"I unintentionally looked away",
"No matter what I do",
"I can't forget your words",
"They still resonate even now",
"Ah, passing through the night, towards the future of dreams",
"I want to reach it",
"I still feel uncertain about that dream",
"But surely",
"Ah, passing through the present, towards tomorrow",
"To our own place",
"Just a little longer, please don't change",
"Just a little longer, your words",
"I'll be waiting for them in that future",
"Only the two of us, unknown to anyone else",
"The night we longed for overlaps with the scenery of summer",
"The fireworks open up, connecting the future and the present",
"Here, with you, I trace that dream",
"The light now illuminates the face beside me",
"Ah, yes, always, for the sake of this scenery",
"Yes, surely, look",
"The two futures now overlap",
"Ah, in the night, with you",
"We arrived at the future",
"It's alright, our feelings",
"Will surely be conveyed, to that day",
"Beyond the dream",
"Ah, passing through the present",
"To the future of tomorrow",
"I can meet you again",
"Just a little longer, please don't end",
"Just a little longer, look",
"The last fireworks now envelop us",
"In a soundless world",
"They resonated, 'I love you'"]
