Invincible smile, the media is captivated
I want to know that secret, it's mysterious
Even her flaws are her domain
You, perfect and deceitful
A genius idol
What did you eat today?
What's your favorite book?
If you go out to play, where would you go?
I haven't eaten anything, that's a secret
No matter what I'm asked, I evade cleverly
It seems easy, but it's hard to see
Actually, it's the taste of honey
There's nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
What's your type? Answer with love
I don't understand what it means to love someone
I can't tell if it's a lie or the truth
Such words make someone fall again
Make them fall in love again
Everyone is captivated by you
You are the perfect and ultimate idol
You won't appear again in this lifetime
The top star, irreplaceable
Ah, with that smile, saying "I love you"
You captivate everyone
Even if those eyes and words are lies
It's complete love
Yes, yes, that girl is special
We are just extras from the start
Supporting roles for the star
It's not all thanks to that girl
There's no way we don't know jealousy
It's not a joke, that's why it's unforgivable
I can't forgive myself for not being perfect like you
I won't acknowledge anyone stronger than you
Everyone believes and worships you
Truly the strongest, invincible idol
No weaknesses in sight
The top star, faintly known
Don't show any weakness
Don't show what you don't want to be known
You must be unique
Yes, that's true love
The media is excited by your special smile
But this secret is completely hidden
A career built on the lie of "I love you"
This is my way of love
Even the flowing sweat is beautiful aqua
These eyelids hide the ruby
I sing, dance, and perform, I am Maria
Yes, lies are the ultimate love
I've never been loved by anyone
I've never loved anyone
Such lies of mine
I believe they'll someday become true
Someday, I'll get everything
Because I'm a greedy idol
I want to love everyone properly
So today, I lie again, these words
Hoping they'll someday become true
But still, I can't say it to you
Ah, I finally said it, this is
Definitely not a lie, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
