    "Now, in the quiet night",
    "I drove the car aimlessly",
    "To my left, you",
    "Your profile illuminated by the moon",
    "Just like searching for memories",
    "If I piece together words",
    "Uncontrollably overflowing",
    "Memories of the days",
    "Since the day I decided to live by your side",
    "The world began to change little by little",
    "Hiding my weakness to be strong",
    "In the days I pretended",
    "One day, suddenly, those eyes appeared",
    "Taught me things I didn't know",
    "As long as I have something to protect",
    "I can become this strong",
    "In the deep, deep darkness",
    "We met and spent time together",
    "Days unlike any other",
    "They were comfortable",
    "No, they were happy",
    "Indeed, look",
    "I was saved",
    "By you",
    "The faint light captured and shined",
    "Like a shooting star, tears",
    "Fell from a clumsy life",
    "Beautiful tears",
    "The kindness hidden in a strong, large body",
    "And that slightly pained face",
    "I find them dear",
    "It's not about appearance",
    "I finally realized",
    "The merciless gunshot tears the night",
    "The breath of farewell attacks",
    "A merciless shooting star shining in an instant",
    "The prayer just disappeared without reaching",
    "In my hands, it burned out",
    "The gentle golden comet",
    "Its beautiful mane",
    "I held tight in the darkness"
